### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fuad, a biotechnologist and self-taught programmer from Bangladesh. I have decided to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of bioinformatics. I would particularly like to study the biochemical mechanisms of immunity and microbial modes of action, thereby designing and developing Nobel drugs by applying computation. My long-term career goal is to establish an independent research laboratory in Bangladesh.
